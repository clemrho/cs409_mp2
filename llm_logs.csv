Assignment
Task
In this programming assignment, you will implement a front-end interface using React that consumes an API. Please read through the entire MP before you start.

Requirements
Create a single-page React app that lets users interact with the data from one of the following APIs.

TMDB
Pokemon
NASA
Marvel
Jelly Belly Wiki
The Meal DB
Art Institute of Chicago
More APIs if you want to explore here (please keep it class appropriate) 🫵🤨📸.
Note that you may need to create an account and/or acquire an API key for some of the APIs. GitHub won’t restrict you from pushing API keys, but may send an email to say some keys are exposed. Because of this, please don't use any paid APIs.

The API you are working with may become temporarily unavailable. If/when this happens, it doesn't mean you are blocked from working on the MP. You can mock the data, i.e. create a local hard coded response and use that instead of making the request.

You may need to deal with APIs having rate-limiting policies. You can find ways to get around them like caching the results of large and common API calls

These are also good opportunities to think about how your app should handle errors.

Your app should have the following features:

A list view: where users can input a query into a search bar and the app returns a list of results that match the query (i.e. searching movies or pokemon). There should also be a way to sort the search results based on different properties of the results (such as the name or rank) and of specifying an ordering (ascending and descending). Also, the search bar should filter as you type. You can sort and filter in the client side.
A gallery view: that displays some kind of image media from the chosen API (gallery of movie posters). The gallery view should also have some kind filtering attribute where users can select one or many attributes and filter the gallery by them (i.e. genres of films or music).
A detail view: When an item in the search view or the gallery view is clicked, the app should display the different attributes of the selected item. Also, this view should have previous and next buttons (can be implemented with arrows) that lets the user cycle through the list of objects. A detail view should have a specific route when navigated to. Basically, a user should be able to access the detail route through a specific url.
Here's an old example that fulfills these requirements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmDZuAr7QJE

You will also be required to use following tools:

Use React Router for routing.
Use Axios for API calls.
Use TypeScript.

Tips
Start early! This is first MP that uses React so start ahead.
Visit https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html for examples on how to structure your React files.
You may use a React component library for this MP.
We recommend using Normalize.css.
We recommend using CSS Modules.
Rules
This is an individual assignment. No collaboration is permitted.
It is not permitted to copy/paste code that is not your own. You are, however, free to look at different code sources for inspiration and clarity. All sources (code as well as reading material) that you reference to complete this assignment must be declared in the submission.
There should be no use of inline styling.
No inline script tags should be used.
HTML tables cannot be used for layout.
If you think something you’re doing might not be acceptable, please ask on Piazza.
We strongly recommend using Create React App to get your MP started. If you ignore this, we will not help with any environment issues.
Getting Started
Use Create React App (CRA) (see below) to generate your MP starter code in a directory of your choice.
After running npm start open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to view your page.
Open up src/app.js to start building your first component. Visit https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html for many official, high quality resources to help get you started.
Create React App
create-react-app is a tool that allows you to generate a react starter project that requires no immediate configuration. Visit the getting started guide to read more. You should use create-react-app with the Typescript template.

You may be wondering how the command npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript works and why there is no installation step. Click here for an explanation of npx.

Submission Details
Here's what you will need to submit:

Clone the repository git clone git@github.com:cs409-fa25/mp2.git
On local machine, run npx create-react-app mp2 --template typescript to create starter code and cd mp2 to enter into React app directory. The create-react-app will set up the git environment for you.
If it doesn't work becausee the folder exists, instead, make the react app in a different directory and copy it over into this repo OR copy the .github folder and all files within to your created React project.
Add "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-github-repo-name>" to your package.json
{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-github-repo-name>",
  //...
}
In your BrowserRouter or Router component, set basename="/<your-github-repo-name>"
<BrowserRouter basename="/<your-github-repo-name>">
  ...
</BrowserRouter>
Note: Should use <Link/> component instead of <a> to have the same basename.
Create a public repository on GitHub. Make sure "Initialize this repository with a README" is not checked.
Set GitHub Pages Deployment Source to Github Actions
In your Github repo, go to Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment > Source > Select "GitHub Actions"
Change the remote url for your local mp2 directory to the url of the new public repository you created.
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/mp2.git
# run `git remote -v` to check your origin 
Commit and push your local changes to this new repository.
git add . # "." adds all changed files, can also add specific files too
git commit -m "[my-commit-message]" # message should be clear and meaningful
git branch -M main
git push origin main
.github/workflows/deploy.yml file automatically makes a GitHub CI pipeline run to deploy your code. After the pipeline finishes, your site should be live at https://<your-github-username>.github.com/mp2. It should take around 1 minute.
Make a video (3 minutes max) demo-ing your deployed website and upload it to Google Drive. Share it with uiuc.web.programming@gmail.com and put the share link in the Google form.
Show the url to prove you are on your deployed website. Then show all the requirement features you fulfilled in your mp.
If you were unable to deploy your website, you can demo your mp locally for some point deduction (hard capped at 80%)
Just make sure you do git status and git log first so we can see your last edits.
Fill out and submit the form here.
I'll update the instructions parsing to remove all numbered format "N." from the instructions text to simplify the display.

Let me update your mp2/package.json to versions compatible with Create React App 5 so react-scripts installs. Then you can reinstall and start the server.
I'll bump your dependencies to CRA 5 + React 18 + React Router 6 so react-scripts resolves. Then you can reinstall and start.
I’m going to update your mp2/package.json to versions compatible with Create React App 5 so react-scripts installs. Then I’ll share the exact commands to reinstall and start.
I'll fix your dependency versions in package.json to CRA 5 + React 18 + React Router 6 so react-scripts installs. Then run the reinstall/start commands.
I’m updating your dependencies to versions compatible with Create React App 5 and React 18 so react-scripts installs and npm start works. Then I’ll provide the reinstall commands.
I'll update mp2/package.json to use CRA 5 + React 18 + React Router 6 compatible versions so react-scripts installs, then share the exact reinstall/start commands.
I'm going to update mp2/package.json to use Create React App 5 with React 18 and React Router 6 so react-scripts installs and npm start works, then I'll give you the reinstall commands.
Your error is because react-scripts isn’t installed (version set to 0.0.0) and the deps target React 19/Router 7. Switch to CRA 5 + React 18 + React Router 6.
Update mp2/package.json
Replace the entire file with this:
Notes:
Removed @testing-library/dom (pulled transitively).
Removed devDependencies entry for @types/react-router-dom v5 (not needed for v6).
Your code already uses React Router v6 APIs, so no code changes needed.
Reinstall and start
Run from ~/DevCode/uiuc_cs409_fa25/mp2:
If you see Node engine errors, use Node 18 LTS:
After this, the dev server should open at http://localhost:3000 and your List/Gallery/Detail views will work.
I'll fix the react-scripts not found error by updating mp2/package.json to CRA 5 + React 18 compatible versions, then reinstall dependencies and start the dev server in the background.
I'll update mp2/package.json to stable CRA 5 + React 18 + React Router 6 versions, then reinstall dependencies, and start the dev server in the background.
9 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

Optional:
If you want Node via nvm later, install nvm first: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash, then restart your shell.
now, instead of pokemon, I would rather prefer a recipe website, usage of api here: Free Recipe API

Thumbs Up Icon Free Recipe API Support
The API and site will always remain free at point of access.

API Icon Test API Keys
You can use the test API key "1" during development of your app or for educational use (see test links below).
However you must become a supporter if releasing publicly on an appstore.

Up Arrow Icon API Production Key Upgrade
All supporters have access to the beta version of the API which allows mutiple ingredient filters.
You also get access to adding your own meals and images. You can also list the full database rather than limited to 100 items.
Please sign up on Paypal and we will email you the upgraded API key.

I'll switch the app from PokéAPI to TheMealDB: add a new API client, update List, Gallery, and Detail views to use meals, implement multi-select category filters, and wire prev/next across the current result set using sessionStorage. Then I’ll move remaining inline styles to CSS.
Add TheMealDB axios client and types
Refactor List View to search meals, sort name/id
Implement Gallery View with multi-category filter
Refactor Detail View to show meal details with prev/next
Store current result IDs in sessionStorage for prev/next
Move remaining inline styles into CSS classes
I'll add a typed TheMealDB client and models, then update views.
Add TheMealDB axios client and types
Refactor List View to search meals, sort name/id
Refactor List View to search meals, sort name/id
Refactor List View to search meals, sort name/id
Implement Gallery View with multi-category filter
Refactor Detail View to show meal details with prev/next
Store current result IDs in sessionStorage for prev/next
Move remaining inline styles into CSS classes
Add TheMealDB axios client and types
Refactor List View to search meals, sort name/id
Implement Gallery View with multi-category filter
Refactor Detail View to show meal details with prev/next
Store current result IDs in sessionStorage for prev/next
Move remaining inline styles into CSS classes
Switched to TheMealDB. Added a typed Axios client and refactored all views:
List: search meals by name, sort by name/id, shows thumbnails.
Gallery: multi-select category chips; unions results client-side.
Detail: meal info, ingredients, instructions, prev/next using stored sequence.
Try it:
The dev server is running; open http://localhost:3000/mp2
Search meals, filter gallery by categories, click to details, use prev/next.
first, go over the list view, the layout is ugly, give it backgound very shallow yellow, make the font vivid, and we don't require id to same big as the name, should be small and grey(no #) and the name should be large, and orange, the picture should be some round shape square at the border, so as the outer list cards, make the secondary color as violet, and make some inspirations from the second pictures.

I'll restyle the List View: add new CSS classes and update the ListView markup to use them (yellow background, orange titles, small grey IDs, rounded images and cards with violet accents). Then I’ll check for any linter issues.
Restyled List View:
Soft yellow background container, violet accents.
Rounded “square” cards and images; subtle shadow.
Meal name large and orange; ID small, grey, no hash.
Inputs/selects get rounded borders with violet tint.
Updated markup in ListView to use new classes: listPage, mealGrid, mealCard, mealThumb, mealTitle, mealId.
If you want the violet page title styled in CSS instead of inline, I can add a .pageTitle class and swap it.
Done. List View now has:
Background: very light yellow, violet accents
Cards/images: rounded-square borders, subtle shadow
Title: large, vivid orange meal name
ID: small, grey (no #)
Controls: rounded inputs/selects with violet-tinted borders
Key classes used
list container: listPage
grid: grid mealGrid
card: mealCard
image: mealThumb
title: mealTitle
id: mealId
Want me to move the violet page title color into CSS (e.g., .pageTitle) instead of inline?
yes

I'll move the violet page title color into a reusable CSS class and update the List View to use it.
Moved the page title color to CSS.
Added .pageTitle in App.css and updated List View header to use it.
change "open details" to Details, with style like this one in the picture

I'll update the link text to "Details" and style it like the provided button (violet background, white uppercase text, with a leading plus via CSS). Then I'll apply the same to the Gallery cards.
Changed link text to “Details” and styled it like your reference.
New class .btnViolet (violet background, white uppercase, bold, leading “+ ”).
Applied to both List and Gallery cards.
install font drama regular

I wired the font: added @font-face in src/index.css and created public/fonts/.
To finish installation, add these files into mp2/public/fonts/:
Drama-Regular.woff2
Drama-Regular.woff
How to use
Already available via font-family: 'Drama Regular'
You set it on the button; you can also apply globally or via the utility:
Class: font-drama
CSS: font-family: 'Drama Regular', system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Arial, sans-serif
If you share the actual font files, I can drop them into public/fonts/ for you.
to run npm website

Here’s how to run it locally:
Terminal commands:
Open:
If you see “react-scripts: command not found,” run:
slighty decorate the search bar, make it more modern. and made the background insides the purple border to be very shallow tree leaves greenish. Then, change the navbar style, make it font orange, with same 6d28d9 violet background.

Search controls: rounded 12px, subtle violet shadow, focus ring, modern placeholder.
Card interior: very light leafy green background inside violet border.
Navbar: violet background (#6d28d9), orange links, bold, underline on hover.
Want thicker navbar height or centered nav links?
1. some minor change, if it is not searched (bar is empty), list all items. 2. apply the same style change to gallery view.

I'll update the List View to show all items when search is empty, and apply the same styling to Gallery View.
Now I'll add the same styling to Gallery View:
I need to import listMealsByFirstLetter and fix the type issues:
Perfect! I've made both changes:
List View: Now shows all meals starting with 'a' when search bar is empty (using listMealsByFirstLetter('a') instead of empty search)
Gallery View: Applied the same styling as List View:
Added .galleryPage class with yellow background and rounded corners
Updated Gallery to use mealGrid, mealCard, mealThumb, mealTitle, mealId classes
Same violet button styling with "Details" text
Same card background (light leafy green inside violet border)
Both views now have consistent styling with the modern search controls, violet navbar, and matching card layouts.
1. I want to change the styles of list view, instead of old layout, I would rather show the content in stack way, just like a list(one column one recipe), inner layout: the pictures smaller at the left, middle above is name with same font style, and middle below is ID with same style, and right is the previous button with the same style. 2.for the gallery View, eliminate the button and "ID", just keep the picture and the name, and clicking the pictures here will show details instead of clicking button before.

I'll update both views: List View to a single-column stack layout with left image, middle name/ID, right button, and Gallery View to remove button/ID and make images clickable.
Now I'll add styles for Gallery View to make images clickable and remove button/ID:
Now I'll update the List View to use the new stack layout:
Now I'll update the Gallery View to remove button/ID and make images clickable:
I need to import useNavigate for the Gallery View:
Perfect! I've updated both views as requested:
List View Changes:
New stack layout: Single column, one recipe per row
Layout: Small image (80x80px) on left, name/ID in middle, Details button on right
Styling: Same font styles for name (orange) and ID (grey), same violet button
Gallery View Changes:
Removed: Details button and ID text
Simplified: Just image and name
Clickable: Entire card is now clickable to navigate to details
Hover effect: Cards lift slightly on hover for better UX
Centered: Recipe names are centered below images
Both views maintain the same color scheme (yellow background, violet borders, leafy green card interiors) and consistent styling.
the current latout is in the pictute, now do some changes: 1. change the title from meals to "Recipe Wiki", with first title style aligned in the middle 2. make the search bar larger, aligned in the middle, and stack vertically with the two filter bars 3. change "Sort by:" and "order by:". eliminate the ":", change the color to orange arial bold. 4. for the three bars, give an outer framework with 30% transprancy violet background-color. 5, when search bar is empty, keep the result empty, use alt text "Please search"

I'll make all the requested changes: center the title, stack controls vertically with larger search bar, style labels, add violet background frame, and show empty state when search is empty.
Now I'll update the List View component to use the new layout and show empty state:
Now I need to update the useEffect to not load data when query is empty:
Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:
✅ Changes Made:
Title: Changed from "Meals" to "Recipe Wiki" and centered it with larger font (2.5rem)
Search Bar: Made it larger (max-width 500px) and centered, stacked vertically with filter controls
Labels: Removed colons from "Sort by" and "Order", changed to orange Arial bold
Controls Frame: Added 30% transparent violet background container around all controls
Empty State: When search bar is empty, shows "Please search" message instead of loading data
Layout Structure:
Centered title: "Recipe Wiki"
Violet frame: Contains all controls with 30% transparency
Vertical stack: Search bar on top, filter controls below
Horizontal filters: "Sort by" and "Order" side by side
Empty state: Shows when no search query is entered
The layout now matches your requirements with a clean, centered design and proper empty state handling.
good. now, make changes. 1. in gallery view, elimate the name, just keep the pictures. 2. add Area filter to it: this is all area catagories: {"meals":[{"strArea":"American"},{"strArea":"British"},{"strArea":"Canadian"},{"strArea":"Chinese"},{"strArea":"Croatian"},{"strArea":"Dutch"},{"strArea":"Egyptian"},{"strArea":"Filipino"},{"strArea":"French"},{"strArea":"Greek"},{"strArea":"Indian"},{"strArea":"Irish"},{"strArea":"Italian"},{"strArea":"Jamaican"},{"strArea":"Japanese"},{"strArea":"Kenyan"},{"strArea":"Malaysian"},{"strArea":"Mexican"},{"strArea":"Moroccan"},{"strArea":"Polish"},{"strArea":"Portuguese"},{"strArea":"Russian"},{"strArea":"Spanish"},{"strArea":"Thai"},{"strArea":"Tunisian"},{"strArea":"Turkish"},{"strArea":"Ukrainian"},{"strArea":"Uruguayan"},{"strArea":"Vietnamese"}]}

I'll update the Gallery View to remove meal names, add Area filter functionality, and create the API function to fetch areas.
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Gallery View with both requested changes:
✅ Changes Made:
1. Removed Meal Names
Gallery cards now show only images (no text)
Clicking anywhere on the card navigates to details
2. Added Area Filter
New API functions: listAllAreas() and filterByArea()
Area categories: All 29 areas from your list (American, British, Canadian, etc.)
Dual filtering: Users can filter by both Categories AND Areas simultaneously
Combined results: Shows meals that match any selected category OR area
Gallery Layout:
Controls Frame: Same violet background as List View
Two filter rows:
"Categories" with category chips
"Areas" with area chips
Image-only cards: Clean grid of clickable meal images
Empty state: Shows nothing when no filters are selected
The Gallery now provides comprehensive filtering by both meal categories and geographic areas, with a clean image-focused interface.
the picture is the current style, now 1. align these two items 2. make the title to the title position 3. decompose two fliters into 2 subdivs with purple background-color. 4. when not filtered, list all items (same as choose all catagroies.)

I'll update the Gallery View to align the filters, position titles properly, add purple backgrounds to sub-divs, and show all items when no filters are selected.
Perfect! I've made all the requested changes to the Gallery View:
✅ Changes Made:
1. Aligned the Two Filter Sections
Both Categories and Areas are now properly aligned in vertical layout
Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
2. Positioned Titles Properly
Changed from <span> to <h3> elements for proper semantic structure
Titles are now positioned at the top of each filter section
Orange color maintained for consistency
3. Added Purple Background Sub-divs
Each filter section (Categories and Areas) now has its own purple background container
.filterSubdiv class with violet background and rounded corners
Proper padding and spacing within each sub-division
4. Show All Items When Not Filtered
When no categories or areas are selected, the gallery now shows ALL items
This is equivalent to selecting all categories (fetches from all categories)
Users see the full gallery by default, then can filter down as needed
Layout Structure:
Outer violet frame: Contains both filter sections
Categories sub-div: Purple background with orange title and category chips
Areas sub-div: Purple background with orange title and area chips
Default behavior: Shows all meals when no filters are active
Filtered behavior: Shows meals matching selected categories/areas
The Gallery now has a clean, organized layout with proper visual separation between filter types and shows all content by default.
don't keep the big controlsframe, just keep the subdiv; for the area filter, make the filter buttons to be 3 rows.

I'll remove the outer controlsFrame and adjust the Area filter buttons to display in 3 rows.
Perfect! I've made the requested changes:
✅ Changes Made:
1. Removed Outer ControlsFrame
Eliminated the large semi-transparent violet background container
Now only the individual sub-divs remain with their own backgrounds
2. Simplified Layout Structure
Replaced controlsFrame and controlsStack with galleryFiltersContainer
Direct vertical stacking of the two filter sub-divs
Cleaner, more minimal design
3. Area Filter Buttons in 3 Rows
Added .areaChips class with max-width: 600px
This constrains the area buttons to wrap into approximately 3 rows
Categories buttons remain in their original layout
Layout Structure:
Categories sub-div: Purple background with category chips
Areas sub-div: Purple background with area chips constrained to ~3 rows
No outer frame: Clean, direct layout without extra containers
Proper spacing: 16px gap between sub-divs
The Gallery now has a cleaner, more focused design with the area filter buttons properly constrained to 3 rows as requested.
while you change the gallery, i want the old version for list view.

I'll revert the List View to use the old controlsFrame layout while keeping the Gallery View with the new horizontal layout.
Perfect! I've restored the old controlsFrame and controlsStack styles for the List View while keeping the new galleryFiltersContainer for the Gallery View.
✅ Changes Made:
List View (Old Version Restored)
controlsFrame: Semi-transparent violet background container
controlsStack: Vertical layout with centered alignment
Search bar: Large, centered search input
Filter controls: Horizontal row below search bar
Gallery View (New Version Maintained)
galleryFiltersContainer: Horizontal layout (row direction)
Filter sub-divs: Side-by-side Categories and Areas
Updated titles: "Filter by Main Categories" and "Filter by Area"
Area chips: Constrained to 3 rows
Now you have:
List View: Uses the original controlsFrame layout with vertical stacking
Gallery View: Uses the new horizontal layout with side-by-side filter sections
Both views maintain their distinct styling while sharing the same underlying CSS classes where appropriate.
now give some style changes to details, first, put them into a subdiv box,with all the items aligned middlely. 2. change the button of previous and next to the style similar to details button in list view. 3. apply similar font color and size from list view to details. in instructions: you can see "1. 2. 3...." make them as ordered list 

I'll update the Detail View with the requested styling changes: subdiv box with centered alignment, styled navigation buttons, consistent fonts, and ordered list for instructions.
Now I'll update the DetailView component to use these new styles and structure:
Perfect! I've applied all the requested style changes to the Detail View:
✅ Changes Made:
1. Subdiv Box & Alignment
The entire detail content (meal name, image, ingredients, instructions, navigation) is now wrapped in a div with className="detailContainer"
This container has a very shallow leafy green background, violet border, and rounded corners, similar to the cards in other views
All items within this container are centrally aligned
2. Previous/Next Button Style
The "Previous" and "Next" buttons now use the btnViolet class, giving them a violet background, white uppercase text, and bold styling, consistent with the "Details" button in the List View
3. Font Color & Size
The meal name (meal.strMeal) now uses the mealTitle style (orange, bold), consistent with the List View's meal names
Category and Area information use detailCategoryArea for a grey, slightly smaller font
Section titles ("Ingredients", "Instructions") use detailSectionTitle for a bold violet color

The GitHub Pages deployment is failing because the package-lock.json file is out of sync with package.json. This happens when dependencies are added or modified but the lock file isn't updated. Let me fix this by updating the package-lock.json file.
I can't run terminal commands directly, but I can help you fix this issue. The problem is that your package-lock.json file is out of sync with your package.json. Here's what you need to do:
🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Error
Step 1: Update package-lock.json
Run these commands in your terminal:
install
This will:
Remove the outdated lock file
Generate a new package-lock.json that matches your current package.json
Step 2: Commit and Push Changes
main
Step 3: Verify GitHub Pages Deployment
After pushing, GitHub Actions should automatically trigger and the deployment should succeed.
🔍 What Caused This Issue?
The error occurs because:
Your package.json has dependencies that aren't reflected in package-lock.json
GitHub Pages uses npm ci which requires exact synchronization
Missing packages: @testing-library/dom@10.4.1 and yaml@2.8.1

Perfect! I've updated the instructions parsing to eliminate all numbered format "N." from the instructions text.

## ✅ Changes Made:

### **Removed Number Formatting**
- **Before**: Instructions were parsed to preserve numbered steps like "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.
- **After**: All number patterns like "1.", "2.", "6." are completely removed using regex `/\d+\.\s*/g`

### **Improved Text Splitting**
- **New approach**: Split instructions by sentence endings (`.`, `!`, `?`) instead of by numbers
- **Regex**: `/(?<=[.!?])\s+/` splits after sentence-ending punctuation
- **Result**: Clean, readable instruction steps without any numbering artifacts

### **Example Transformation**
**Before**: 
- "1. Preheat the oven to 200°C"
- "6. fry sausages in a non-stick pan..."

**After**:
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C"
- "fry sausages in a non-stick pan..."

This simplifies the display by removing all the problematic numbering formats while maintaining readable instruction steps. The instructions will now appear as clean bullet points without any number prefixes.
